🎮 Developed a Number Guessing Game in Java during my internship at CodeSoft! 🚀

🔍 Implemented using Java's Random class and Scanner for user input, the game allows players to guess a number between 1 and 100. Each round tracks the number of attempts and calculates a score based on the speed of guessing.

🏆 Successfully completed multiple rounds and managed to achieve a final score of [insert your final score here] over [insert number of rounds played] rounds!

📊 This project enhanced my skills in Java programming, user input handling, and logical problem-solving. Looking forward to applying these skills to more challenging projects!
